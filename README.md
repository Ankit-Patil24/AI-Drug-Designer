# 💊 AI Drug Designer

A simple AI-driven de novo drug screening app using RDKit and Streamlit. Upload SMILES, compute drug-likeness (QED, logP, MW), and visualize molecules.

## 🚀 Features
- Validate and filter SMILES
- Compute QED, SA (simulated), Lipinski compliance
- Visualize molecules with properties
- Download cleaned dataset

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-drug-designer-streamlit.git
cd AI-Drug-Designer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app/drug_designer_app.py
```

## 🧪 Sample Input
